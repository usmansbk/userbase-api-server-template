## Authentication and Authorization directive
https://docs.amplify.aws/javascript/tools/cli-legacy/auth-directive/
Any field with no @auth directive is public by default
Calling the @auth directive without any rules means the user must be authenticated
Calling the @auth(rules: [{ ... }]) with rules means the user must be authenticated and authorized according to the set rules
**Authorization rules operate on the deny-by-default principle**. Meaning that if an authorization rule is not specifically configured, it is denied.
